# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The GitDocAI team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:

security@gitdoc.ai

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us better understand and resolve the issue, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. Confirm receipt of your vulnerability report
2. Assess the severity and impact of the vulnerability
3. Work on a fix and coordinate the release timeline with you
4. Keep you informed of our progress
5. Credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
